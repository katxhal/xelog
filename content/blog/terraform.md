# Terraform

- Terraform is an open-source tool for provisioning and managing infrastructure as code.
â€¢ It codifies infrastructure into configuration files that are editable, reusable and sharable.
â€¢ It supports a wide range of infrastructure providers (AWS, GCP, Azure, VMware, etc.) and can manage their lifecycles.
â€¢ Infrastructure is defined using the HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) in a simple and declarative manner.
â€¢ It enables infrastructure to be versioned, tested and collaborated on.
â€¢ It helps you build, change and improve your infrastructure in a consistent and predictable fashion.

You can find the Terraform documentation at [https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html).
The documentation includes getting started guides, concepts, provider documentation, and more.
